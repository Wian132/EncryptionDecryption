# EncryptionDecryption

This project was developed during our 2nd year at university as part of our coursework. The goal was to create a simple yet effective encryption and decryption tool using Python. This tool can encrypt and decrypt various types of files using sophisticated methods like SHA-256 hashing.

## Features

- **File Encryption:** Encrypts various types of files to protect their content.
- **File Decryption:** Decrypts the encrypted files to restore their original content.
- **SHA-256 Hashing:** Uses SHA-256, a secure hashing algorithm, to ensure data integrity and security.

## Prerequisites

- **Python:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Wian132/EncryptionDecryption.git
   cd EncryptionDecryption
